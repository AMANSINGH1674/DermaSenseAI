# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Issue
The app is currently using placeholder Supabase credentials, which means authentication won't work properly.

## Solution
You need to set up your Supabase environment variables:

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the project root with your actual Supabase credentials:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

2. **Get your Supabase credentials:**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project or use an existing one
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
   - Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`

3. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Current Behavior
- Without proper Supabase credentials, the app will show "Supabase not configured" errors
- The dashboard is now properly protected and will redirect to login when not authenticated
- Login/signup forms will show configuration errors until you set up the environment variables

## What's Fixed
- ✅ Dashboard route is now protected with `RequireAuth`
- ✅ No more automatic redirects to dashboard on failed login attempts
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ Signup redirects to correct `/login` path
